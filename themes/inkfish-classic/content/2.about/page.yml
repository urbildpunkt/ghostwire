  ### Inkfish Classic User Guide
  Built to be fully resposive with some easy customizability.
 
  **Stacey v3.0** 
  This theme is built using the latest version of Stacey and is not compatabile with earlier versions.
  The new documentation can be found <a href="https://github.com/kolber/stacey/wiki" target="_blank">here</a>.

  **Installation**
  The installation is as easy as uploading the files to your host, you can follow the instructions <a href="http://www.staceyapp.com/installation/" target="_blank">here</a>.
  If you are upgrading from a previous Stacey installation, I would recommend doing a clean install and then bringing back in your conent because it is likely you are using an earlier version.

  **Index**
  The Index page lists your featured projects, which can be set with <code>featured: true (or false)</code> variable.
 

  **Portfolio & Blog**
  The portfolio and blog pages are set to list entries in reverse order, so whenever you add a new content folder it will be placed at the top of the list.

  You can use the <code>tags:</code> variable as a tagline or to categorize your posts.

  **Categories**
  Project categories are nestable, see Client Work in the Portfolio section for an example.
  The hierarchy of this example is: <code>Portfolio / Client Work / Client Name(s) / Client Project(s)</code>

  The portfolio.yml file of any category folder(ex. Client Work) must have a <code>categories: true</code> variable.

  **Image Galleries**
  The image gallery is made to be responsive, but the best default size for your images is 800x600.

  You can include captions with your images:
  <pre>
  01.png:
    caption: You can specify an image caption.
  02.png:
    caption: You can specify an image caption.
  </pre>

  **Contact Page or Link**
  If you don't want to have a dedicated contact page, delete this section. 

  You can also add this variable to the _shared.yml file after deleting the contact page to make it a direct email link instead:
  <code>'email: name@domain.com'</code> 

  **Footer**
  You can create social links by adding the following variables to the _shared.yml file:
  <pre>
  linkedin: url
  facebook: url
  googleplus: url
  twitter: url (ex. http://twitter.com/username)
  adn: url  
  tumblr: url
  instagram: url
  pinterest: url
  dribbble: url
  flickr: url
  youtube: url
  </pre>
